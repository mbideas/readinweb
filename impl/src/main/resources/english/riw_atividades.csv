1;2;"Freud: A brief biography";"<p>Sigmund Freud (1856-1939) was the founder of psychoanalysis. He was born of <a href='#' data-toggle='tooltip' class='translation' data-placement='top' title='Judeu'>Jewish</a> parents at  Freiberg in Moravia on May 6, 1856. From the age of 4 until the age of 82 he lived in Vienna. As a student he  found it difficult to decide on a profession, because he was impressed by the work of Darwin and other  scientists of the period, but he was also attracted to the history of culture and philosophy. Although originally  interested in <a href='#' data-toggle='tooltip' class='translation' data-placement='top' trans='qu&iacute;mica'>chemistry</a>, he found he had greater ability in dealing with physiology and anatomy, so he  <a href='#' data-toggle='tooltip' class='translation' data-placement='top' title='consequentemente'>eventually</a> decided to study medicine.</p>    <p>        He liked research, but did not have the financial means to follow a career in this area, especially  after he married Martha Bernay in 1886. Shortly afterwards, he began practice as a neurologist. He heard  about an extraordinary experience of an outstanding Viennese physician and thinker, Josef Breuer, who had  cured a patient of the symptoms of hysteria through the use of hypnosis as a technique to promote  <a href='#' data-toggle='tooltip' class='translation' data-placement='top' trans='lembran&ccedil;a'>recollection</a> of past events. This technique was successfully used by Freud in the treatment of various  patients, and was the starting point of what later became psychoanalysis. Freud later replaced hypnotism  with free association. This substitution of free association for hypnotism <a href='#' data-toggle='tooltip' class='translation' data-placement='top' title='permitiu'>allowed</a> him to isolate and study the  phenomena of resistance and transference. Resistance refers to the uncovering of repressed experiences  while transference reflects the patient&#8242;s emotional ties to the analyst. These two factors have ever since  remained central in the technique of psychoanalysis. </p>   <p>        Freud&#8242;s discoveries about the sexuality of children met opposition, <a href='#' data-toggle='tooltip' class='translation' data-placement='top' title='mal entendido'>misunderstanding</a>, and abuse  from the beginning, and for ten years Freud worked alone at psychoanalysis. Recognition of analysis was  slow to come; only after analysis attained comparatively broad acceptance in the United States did the  opposition assume a less vehement character. In about 1906 he was joined by a number of colleagues, and  by 1910 the International Psychoanalytic Association was founded. </p> <p>          Freud had six children, and the youngest, Anna Freud, became a famous psychoanalyst <a href='#' data-toggle='tooltip' class='translation' data-placement='top' trans='por seus pr&oacute;prios m&eacute;ritos'>in her own  right</a>. After the annexation of Austria by Nazi Germany, Freud moved to London, where he died in 1939.  </p> <p>          Freud&#8242;s work contains striking discoveries; it is also the expression of a powerful mind, capable of  extracting the fullest meaning from such discoveries. His unfailing intellectual courage allowed him to face  previously unknown aspects of the human mind. The characteristic elements of his style of thinking and his  creativity remained <a href='#' data-toggle='tooltip' class='translation' data-placement='top' title='intacto'>unimpaired</a> either by age or disease (He suffered from cancer from the age of 67), and  he wrote one of his most lucid and significant papers at the age of 80.  </p> ";"O texto que voc&#234; vai ler &#233; uma biografia sobre a vida de Freud.

1;5;"Pneumonia runs riot in Brazil&#8242;s cr&#232;ches";"<p>Brazilian mothers who send their children to a cr&egrave;che increase their chances of developing pneumonia, according to a study carried out in the city of Fortaleza. The study found that the risk of catching  the disease, one of the <a href='#' data-toggle='tooltip' class='translation' data-placement='top' trans='principais, mais importantes'>leading</a> causes of child mortality in developing countries, increased more than <a href='#' data-toggle='tooltip' class='translation' data-placement='top' title='cinco vezes'>fivefold</a>  in children sent do cr&egrave;ches.    </p><p>       The authors say this is the first study to show a link between childcare and pneumonia. &ldquo;The finding  is of significant public <a href='#' data-toggle='tooltip' class='translation' data-placement='top' trans='sa&uacute;de'>health</a> importance for countries such as Brazil with growing urban populations and  increasing need by mothers to find work outside the home&rdquo;, they say.   </p><p>        <a href='#' data-toggle='tooltip' class='translation' data-placement='top' title='Aguda'>Acute</a> respiratory infection <a href='#' data-toggle='tooltip' class='translation' data-placement='top' title='explica'>account</a> for one of the 15 million deaths among the under-fives each  year in developing countries.

Children from families with  seven or more children were 2.36 times as likely to contract it. However, the most <a href='#' data-toggle='tooltip' class='translation' data-placement='top' title='alarmante'>starling</a> finding was that  attendance at daycare centres increased the risk by 5.22 times.     </p><p>      &ldquo;In theory, a well-managed <a href='#' data-toggle='tooltip' class='translation' data-placement='top' trans='cen&aacute;rio, ambiente'>setting</a> should not increase the risk of severe respiratory infection in a  healthy child&rdquo;, says the report.

2;1;"Why women don&#8242;t start wars";"<p>Women do not avoid fighting because they are fragile or <a href='#' data-toggle='tooltip' class='translation' data-placement='top' title='medrosas'>scared</a>, but because they have a greater <a href='#' data-toggle='tooltip' class='translation' data-placement='top' trans='interesse, for&#231;a'>stake</a> than men in staying alive to <a href='#' data-toggle='tooltip' class='translation' data-placement='top' trans='criar, educar'>rear</a> their children. Women compete with each other just as  tenaciously as men, but with a <a href='#' data-toggle='tooltip' class='translation' data-placement='top' title='sutileza'>subtlety</a> that reduces their chances of being killed or injured, says  Anne Campbell of the department of psychology at the University of Durham.</p><p>Across almost all cultures and nationalities, men have a much smaller role than women in  rearing children. &ldquo;Males go for quantity of children rather than quality of care for offspring, which  means that the parental investment of women is much greater,&rdquo; says Campbell. And unlike men,  who cannot be sure that their children have not been fathered <a href='#' data-toggle='tooltip' class='translation' data-placement='top' title='sorrateiramente'>on the sly</a> by other men, women can  always be certain that half an offspring&#8242;s genes are theirs.</p><p>Women have therefore evolved a stronger impulse than men to see their children grow up  into adults. Men&#8242;s psychological approach is geared to fathering as many children as possible. To  make this strategy work and to attract partners, a man needs to establish and advertise that he is  the strongest, the most aggressive, the most determined or the smartest among his peers.  Throughout evolution this has resulted in displays of male aggression ranging in scale from  playground fights to world wars.</p><p>Men can afford to take more risks because as parents they are more <a href='#' data-toggle='tooltip' class='translation' data-placement='top' trans='dispens&#225;veis'>expendable</a>. Women,  meanwhile, can only ensure reproductive success by overseeing the development of their children  which means avoiding death. The positive value of staying alive drives everything. This means that  if women do need to compete &#8212; perhaps for a partner &#8212; they choose low-risk rules of engagement.  They use less direct tactics than men, such as discrediting rivals by spreading malicious rumors.  And unlike men who glory in feats of dominance, women do better by <a href='#' data-toggle='tooltip' class='translation' data-placement='top' title='escondendo'>concealing</a> their actions and  their &ldquo;victories&rdquo; .</p><p>But there is no doubt, says Campbell, that the universal domination of culture by males has  exaggerated these differences in attitudes to physical aggression. Females are recognized as  being non-aggressive and the weaker sex. When women are aggressive, says Campbell, they are  told that their behavior is &ldquo;odd or abnormal&rdquo;.</p>   ";;;80
2;2;"Soaps and credit ensure reduction in Brazil&#8242;s population growth";"<p>Brazil has become one of the developing world&#8242;s great successes at reducing population growth &#8212;  but more by accident then <a href='#' data-toggle='tooltip' class='translation' data-placement='top' title='planejamento'>design</a>, says a demographer at Harvard University. While overpopulated  countries such as India have made efforts to reduce birth rates, Brazil has had better results  without really trying, says George Martine, a visiting scholar at Harvard&#8242;s Center of Population and  Development Studies.</p><p>Brazil&#8242;s population growth rate has been going downwards from 2.99 per cent a year  between 1951 and 1960 to 1.93 percent a year between 1981 and 1990, and Brazilian women now  have only 2.7 children on <a href='#' data-toggle='tooltip' class='translation' data-placement='top' trans='m&eacute;dia'>average</a>. Martine says this figure may have fallen still further since 1990,  an achievement that makes it the envy of many other Third World countries. &ldquo;Brazil has never had  a family planning programme, yet the decline in the fertility rate has been <a href='#' data-toggle='tooltip' class='translation' data-placement='top' title='duas vezes'>twice</a> as fast as that of  India,&rdquo; says Martine.</p><p>Martine sees a correlation between this decline and, among other things, soap operas and  credit programmes introduced in the 1970s. Both played an important, though indirect, role in  lowering the birth rate. Brazil is one of the world&#8242;s biggest producers of soap operas, which first  became popular in the late 1960&#8242;s. Globo, Brazil&#8242;s most popular television network, shows three  hours of soaps six nights a week, while three other companies all show at least one hour a night.  Most soaps are based on <a href='#' data-toggle='tooltip' class='translation' data-placement='top' title='rico'>wealthy</a> characters living the high life in big cities.</p><p>According to Martine, <a href='#' data-toggle='tooltip' class='translation' data-placement='top' title='embora'>although</a> soaps had never really tried to work in a message about the  problems of reproduction, they show middle and upper class values - not many children, different  attitudes towards sex, women working. &ldquo;They sent this image to all parts of Brazil. It was an indirect  effect. It made people conscious of other patterns of <a href='#' data-toggle='tooltip' class='translation' data-placement='top' title='comportamento'>behaviour</a> and other values, which were put  into a very attractive package,&rdquo; says Martine.</p><p>The credit programmes, which cannot be overlooked as another cause for the decrease in  population growth, were also introduced in the 1970&#8242;s to encourage poorer segments of the  population to become consumers. Items, such as shoes, could be bought in monthly instalments.  &ldquo;This led to an enormous change in consumption patterns and increased consumption was  incompatible with unlimited procreation,&rdquo; says Martine.</p><p>Martine, who has studied Brazilian population <a href='#' data-toggle='tooltip' class='translation' data-placement='top' title='crescimento'>growth</a> for 20 years, expects the country&#8242;s  population, currently around 150 million, to stabilise in the first quarter of the next century at around  250 million.</p>";"Durante a leitura busque inferir o sentido de &#8242;soap&#8242; que aparece no texto.";;63
2;3;"The importance of being useless";"<p>In times when governmental resources are limited, it is common to question the use of public funds  to support studies that are not directly &ldquo;useful&rdquo; to society. Making reference to a particular article published  by the Canadian press in the early 1990&#8242;s, entitled &ldquo;In time of government <a href='#' data-toggle='tooltip' class='translation' data-placement='top' trans='restri&ccedil;&atilde;o, limita&ccedil;&atilde;o'>restraint</a>, how much do we need to know about eunuchs in imperial China&rdquo;, Arturo Sagally criticises the fact that the press judgements of  research proposals are often based not on the projects themselves but on their titles. Titles may be  irrelevant, uninformative for non-experts in the field. For example, it is possible to think that early in this  century many journalists and even scientists would probably have reacted negatively to a research title such  as &ldquo; The special theory of relativity&rdquo;.</p><p>Furthermore, the conception of &ldquo;usefulness&rdquo; in science is not so easily established. If one supports  the idea that only &ldquo;useful&rdquo; research merits public grants then it is necessary to clarify the criteria for  usefulness adopted. A popular choice is to define priorities in economic terms. Within this particular point of  view, it is expected that scientific research should only receive public funds when it is good for the country&#8242;s  economy. But such a narrow definition of knowledge production would never contemplate the possibility of  studying the past or trying to understand the universe simply because such knowledge is not linked to  economic prosperity.</p><p>A more generous definition of &ldquo;useful&rdquo; is &ldquo;beneficial to mankind&rdquo;. However such a definition raises  the question of what precisely is meant by &ldquo;beneficial&rdquo;. The Nobel Committees must know the answer,  because they award the prestigious prizes to those who have most benefited mankind in physics, chemistry,  medicine, literature and peace. In some instances, however, such as the case of Nobel prize-winning  physicist Richard Feynman, it is evident that at times important original research has its origins in purely  speculative or even playful intentions. Feynman&#8242;s research was initially triggered by his own curiosity.  Observing a wobbling plate that had been thrown in the air, he started to play with the equations describing  its motion. As he later would report &ldquo;there was no importance to what I was doing, but <a href='#' data-toggle='tooltip' class='translation' data-placement='top' title='no final das coisas'>ultimately</a> there was.  The diagrams and the whole business that I got the Nobel prize for came from that <a href='#' data-toggle='tooltip' class='translation' data-placement='top' title='brincadeira'>piddling</a> around with the  <a href='#' data-toggle='tooltip' class='translation' data-placement='top' title='freesbe'>wobbling plate</a>&rdquo;.</p><p>It is possible to establish a parallel between the totality of all research and the pile of <a href='#' data-toggle='tooltip' class='translation' data-placement='top' title='sementes'>seeds</a> of an  ancient Greek paradox. If we remove a seed from the pile of seeds, we still have a pile. But if we keep  removing the seeds, <a href='#' data-toggle='tooltip' class='translation' data-placement='top' title='consequentemente'>eventually</a> we will not have a pile any more. If we are supporting research for society&#8242;s  needs the question certainly is how much can we drop without destroying the pile?</p>";;;82

He developed alopecia, a condition in which not only the hair from the head  drops off but also most of the hair from the eyelashes and eyebrows. Although his weekly income  was a million dollars, his digestion was so bad that he could eat only <a href='#' data-toggle='tooltip' class='translation' data-placement='top' trans='bolachas tipo &#225;gua e sal'>crackers</a> and milk. He,  therefore, started suffering from malnutrition. It was generally agreed that his case was hopeless  and that he would not live another year.

While his body was skinny and malnourished, his <a href='#' data-toggle='tooltip' class='translation' data-placement='top' title='alma'>soul</a> was restless and tormented.</p><p>Then John D. began to do some thinking in his long sleepless nights.

With a deepening sense of brotherhood, he then established the Rockefeller  Foundation so that some of his fortune could be channelled to needed areas.</p><p>When he began to think outwardly about the needs of others and to act unselfishly, he  started to sleep, to eat normally, and to enjoy life in general. The bitterness, rancour and self-  centeredness went out of his life. And into the soul of John D. Rockefeller came refreshing streams  of love and gratitude from those whom he was helping. He, who had been so lifeless, now teemed  with vibrancy and experienced healthful and enjoyable living until he was ninety-eight years old.</p><p>When grateful citizens of Cleveland, Ohio, once congratulated him, he spoke from his own  experience: &ldquo;Turn your thoughts upon the higher things of life. Be of service to humanity. Turn your  thoughts into channels of usefulness; look forward to a determination that something useful shall  come out of your success (...) Do everything you can for the betterment of your fellowmen and in  doing this you will enjoy life the better.&rdquo;</p>";;;58
2;5;"Turning America into a toy store";"<p>The Southern Baptist Convention in June 1997 generated a lot of media attention when it  called for a boycott of the Disney Company for promoting &#8242;immoral ideologies such as  homosexuality&#8242;. The Southern Baptists were angry because Disney <a href='#' data-toggle='tooltip' class='translation' data-placement='top' title='patrocina'>sponsors</a> &ldquo;Gay Days&rdquo; at its  theme parks, provides health benefits to the domestic partners of gay <a href='#' data-toggle='tooltip' class='translation' data-placement='top' title='empregados'>employees</a>, and publishes  books about growing up gay.</p><p>The Baptists got it right in assuming that something was <a href='#' data-toggle='tooltip' class='translation' data-placement='top' title='errado'>amiss</a> in Disney&#8242;s image as an icon  of clean childhood fun and healthy family entertainment, but they got the reason wrong. Disney  should not be condemned because it refuses to endorse homophobic practices in its labor  operations and television programming but because its pretense to innocence camouflages a  powerful cultural force and corporate <a href='#' data-toggle='tooltip' class='translation' data-placement='top' title='monumento'>monolith</a> &#8212; in Eric Smoodin&#8242;s words &ldquo;a kind of Tennessee  Valley Authority of leisure and entertainment&rdquo; &#8212; that <a href='#' data-toggle='tooltip' class='translation' data-placement='top' trans='tornar em um bem de consumo um objeto vend&#225;vel'>commodifies</a> culture, sanitizes historical  memory, and constructs children&#8242;s identities exclusively within the ideology of consumerism.</p><p>Far from being a model of moral leadership and social responsibility, Disney monopolizes  media power, limits the free flow of information, and undermines substantive public debate. Disney  poses a serious threat to democracy by corporatizing public space and limiting the avenues of  public expression and choice. Disney does not, of course, have the power to launch armies,  dismantle the <a href='#' data-toggle='tooltip' class='translation' data-placement='top' trans='bem estar social e econ&#244;mico'>welfare state</a> or eliminate basic social programs for children; Disney&#8242;s influence is  more subtle and pervasive. It shapes public consciousness through its enormous economic <a href='#' data-toggle='tooltip' class='translation' data-placement='top' title='investimentos'>holdings</a> and cultural power.</p><p>Disney has always understood the connection between learning and power and their relationship to culture and politics. As one of the most powerful media conglomerates in the world,  Disney promotes cultural homogeneity and political conformity, waging a <a href='#' data-toggle='tooltip' class='translation' data-placement='top' title='batalha'>battle</a> against individuals  and groups who believe that central do democratic public life is the necessity of democratizing  cultural institutions, including the mass media.</p><p>What the southern Baptists missed was that Disney&#8242;s alleged transgression of family  values and morality has nothing to do with its labor policies or representations of gays and lesbians.  On the contrary, Disney&#8242;s threat to civic life comes from its role as a transnational communications  industry capable of ideological influence over vast segments of the American cultural <a href='#' data-toggle='tooltip' class='translation' data-placement='top' trans='cen&#225;rio'>landscape</a>  and, increasingly, the rest of the world.

3;2;"A very good deal (For whom?)";"<p>In France, there is an unusual practice called &ldquo;en viager&rdquo;, in which the <a href='#' data-toggle='tooltip' class='translation' data-placement='top' title='idosa'>elderly</a> owner of a piece of <a href='#' title='real-state' trans='im&oacute;vel'>real-state</a> receives a monthly <a href='#' data-toggle='tooltip' class='translation' data-placement='top' title='renda'>income</a> from a perspective buyer, who then takes over the property when the  original owner dies.

But last December it was Raffray  who died, having paid more than $184,000 for an apartment in which he never got to live.

3;3;"Documenting disappearing species";"<p>EXTINCTION of species is a natural process. The fossil <a href='#' data-toggle='tooltip' class='translation' data-placement='top' title='registro'>record</a> indicates that most, if not all, species  have a finite <a href='#' data-toggle='tooltip' class='translation' data-placement='top' title='tempo de vida'>lifespan</a>, averaging somewhere between 1 and 10 million years. There is no <a href='#' data-toggle='tooltip' class='translation' data-placement='top' trans='d&uacute;vida'>doubt</a>, however,  that since their appearance on the planet, human beings <a href='#' data-toggle='tooltip' class='translation' data-placement='top' title='desencadearam'>have triggered</a> extinctions on a scale and at a <a href='#' data-toggle='tooltip' class='translation' data-placement='top' title='intensidade'>rate</a> comparable with the major extinction events of the geological past. </p><p>     In a preliminary report on global diversity, the World Conservation Monitoring Centre, in Cambridge,  lists 311 scientifically described species which have perished since 1600. That <a href='#' data-toggle='tooltip' class='translation' data-placement='top' trans='n&uacute;mero'>figure</a> includes 96 invertebrates, 24 fish, 20 reptiles, 117 birds and 54 mammals. In addition, 13 species &#8212; the American black-  footed ferret, the bison-like wisent, the dromedary, the Arabian oryx, Przewalski&#8242;s horse, P&egrave;re David&#8242;s deer  and seven species of Polynesian tree snails &#8212; have been exterminated in the <a href='#' data-toggle='tooltip' class='translation' data-placement='top' trans='&agrave; solta'>wild</a>, surviving only in captivity.     </p><p>      The WCMC data show that islands are the most important sites of known extinctions. More than 180  of         the      documented            extinctions       have         taken        place       on islands. This pattern was established early on. For example, when the Polynesians settled the Hawaiian  islands during the 4th and 5th centuries, they exterminated roughly half of the 100 local land birds. </p><p> Island birds are at particular risk. More than 90 per cent of recorded bird extinctions since 1600 have been  on islands. There are several possible reasons for the increased vulnerability of birds. The most obvious is  that island species have limited <a href='#' data-toggle='tooltip' class='translation' data-placement='top' title='variedades'>ranges</a> and often low populations, so that they are more likely to be exterminated by a single cause or event. In addition, island species, such as the flightless dodos of the  Mascarene Islands, seem particularly susceptible to predation from introduced species.  </p><p> The WCMC is presently compiling a comprehensive compendium of biodiversity data.

They were from Rio das Pedras, a  slum of <a href='#' data-toggle='tooltip' class='translation' data-placement='top' title='de madeira'>wooden</a> shanties and open <a href='#' data-toggle='tooltip' class='translation' data-placement='top' title='esgotos'>sewers</a> only a short distance from the elegant Barra beach district. But  they were not the only participants in this week-long series of revolts. Other spectacular confrontations took  place last week, when impoverished families took over vacant lots and half-completed housing projects in  more than a dozen incidents throughout the city. </p><p>         The publicly funded condominium complex in the Barra district had already brought criticism from  spokesmen of the Brazilian political left, such as 69-year-old socialist politician Leonel Brizola, whose recent  <a href='#' data-toggle='tooltip' class='translation' data-placement='top' title='posse'>inauguration</a> as governor of Rio may well have encouraged the occupations. Said Brizola: &ldquo;You have to  admire the fact that these people didn&#8242;t act earlier. The complex, built with public funding, has been empty for  seven years, next to people who live in a <a href='#' data-toggle='tooltip' class='translation' data-placement='top' trans='p&acirc;ntano'>swamp</a>, with thousands of children being raised in miserable  conditions.&rdquo; </p><p>         Land hunger and the need for decent housing are explosive social issues in Brazil, and have led to a deep concern in government circles that the recent housing <a href='#' data-toggle='tooltip' class='translation' data-placement='top' trans='ocupa&ccedil;&otilde;es'>takeovers</a> might spread to other areas in the  country. Pro-invaders and anti-invaders face each other in court battles, in government offices, in the press  and at the sites. The problem has become one of property rights vs. human rights, with slum <a href='#' data-toggle='tooltip' class='translation' data-placement='top' title='moradores'>dwellers</a>,  progressive church leaders and left-wing politicians in confrontation with property developers, military police  and the political right. Said Arnaldo Martins dos Santos, who along with his wife and two children occupied  one of the condominiums: &ldquo;Poor people need a place of their own.&rdquo;   </p><p>      Some newspapers condemned the takeovers. Wrote Rio&#8242;s O Globo: &ldquo;Invasions are inadmissible  under any pretext. Property rights should be inviolable in a democratic society.&rdquo; City officials are doing their  best to avoid violence, but in the heated controversy neither side will back down <a href='#' data-toggle='tooltip' class='translation' data-placement='top' trans='prontamente, de boa vontade'>willingly</a>. Since the  condominium occupations, Rio developers have been hiring armed guards to defend their half-finished buildings, adding to the possibility of increased confrontational violence. So far, the law has favoured the  owners: recently, a federal judge ordered the invaders from Rio das Pedras out of the $100,000,000  condominiums, giving them 30 days to pack their meagre possessions and leave.     </p><p>     Despite water and electricity shortages, however, most proud new occupiers seem intent on staying.

3;5;"Isaac the torturer";"<p>PRINCIPIA is arguably the most significant publication in the history of science. Without <a href='#' data-toggle='tooltip' class='translation' data-placement='top' trans='d&uacute;vida'>doubt</a>, Isaac  Newton was the greatest scientist Britain has ever produced, if also an isolated, obsessive, cruel genius. Michael White&#8242;s biography does describe the great man&#8242;s scientific achievements, but the real focus is the  events in Newton&#8242;s tormented personal life.    </p><p>       Newton&#8242;s early childhood was marked by rejection and <a href='#' data-toggle='tooltip' class='translation' data-placement='top' trans='&oacute;dio'>hatred</a>. His mother, Hannah, was <a href='#' data-toggle='tooltip' class='translation' data-placement='top' title='enviuvou'>widowed</a> before Isaac was born, and when she re-married, her new husband refused to accept her three-year-old son  into his home. He never forgot the pain of abandonment.    </p><p>       An <a href='#' data-toggle='tooltip' class='translation' data-placement='top' title='amargurado'>embittered</a> man, Newton lived a life full of <a href='#' data-toggle='tooltip' class='translation' data-placement='top' title='vingativas'>vengeful</a> disputes, including long-running battles with  John Flamsteed over access to astronomical data, with Gottfried Wilhelm von Leibnitz over who invented  calculus, and with Robert Hooke over virtually everything imaginable. White does not <a href='#' data-toggle='tooltip' class='translation' data-placement='top' title='economiza'>skimp</a> when describing these hostile conflicts.   </p><p>      As the subtitle suggests, there are descriptions of Newton&#8242;s secret life-long fascination with alchemy throughout the book. Newton wrote more than a million words on the subject, but many other members of  the Royal Society privately shared Newton&#8242;s obsession. Alchemists tended to work in secret to avoid the  <a href='#' data-toggle='tooltip' class='translation' data-placement='top' title='ira'>wrath</a> of the church and prosecution under an anti-alchemy law passed by Henry IV. Later monarchs were  slightly more tolerant, hoping that discovery of the philosopher&#8242;s stone might help the <a href='#' data-toggle='tooltip' class='translation' data-placement='top' trans='A Coroa Brit&acirc;nica, A Monarquia Brit&acirc;nica'>Crown</a> to pay off its debts, but the law remained in force. </p><p>       White gives enlightening <a href='#' data-toggle='tooltip' class='translation' data-placement='top' title='relatos'>accounts</a> of Newton&#8242;s exploits in alchemy and his scientific research, but he  also attempts to go one step further by arguing that the <a href='#' data-toggle='tooltip' class='translation' data-placement='top' title='a primeira'>former</a> influenced and inspired the <a href='#' data-toggle='tooltip' class='translation' data-placement='top' trans='a &uacute;ltima'>latter</a>.

But is this the real explanation?</p><p>Carol Holland of the University of Leeds and Patrick Rabbit of the University of Manchester believe  elderly people who have lost their independence simply prefer to talk about early experiences, because their  present lives are relatively uneventful (Psychology, vol. 82, p. 29).</p><p>The psychologists compared how two groups of elderly volunteers of equivalent age and general  intelligence recalled events in their lives. Members of one group lived in residential care, while the others led  independent lives.</p><p>Holland and Rabbit found that people in residential care recalled more memories from their early  lives than from their recent lives. They found the opposite in the independent elderly.</p><p>The psychologists suggest that the people in residential care spend more time rehearsing earlier  events. The independent"" group reported rehearsing early memories less often than recent memories. In  contrast, people in residential care generally rehearsed early memories more often.</p><p>The study reminds us that, in trying to understand ageing memory, it is not the sort of things that are  remembered that is important, but why they are remembered. In residential care homes, reminiscence is  actively encouraged by the staff and enjoyed by the residents.

The building is <a href='#' data-toggle='tooltip' class='translation' data-placement='top' trans='famosa, renomada'>renowned</a> both for its beauty and the love story that inspired its construction. It may be said that this tomb,  built in the small city of Agra in north central India, has no <a href='#' data-toggle='tooltip' class='translation' data-placement='top' trans='par, igual'>match</a> upon earth, for mortal remains have never  been housed in greater grandeur.</p><p>The love story started in 1612, when Mumtaz Mahal, a lovely young girl, married Shah Jehan (then  Prince Khurram). The marriage, although the Prince&#8242;s second, was a true love <a href='#' data-toggle='tooltip' class='translation' data-placement='top' trans='uni&#227;o'>match</a>. The princess joined  her husband on all his journeys and military expeditions, as his <a href='#' data-toggle='tooltip' class='translation' data-placement='top' title='companheiro'>comrade</a> and counsellor.

Unfortunately, the  <a href='#' data-toggle='tooltip' class='translation' data-placement='top' title='imperatriz'>empress</a> died giving birth to their fourteenth child, only three years after Shah Jehan&#8242;s accession to the  throne.</p><p>Overpowered by <a href='#' data-toggle='tooltip' class='translation' data-placement='top' trans='grande dor, sofrimento'>grief</a>, the husband decided to build his beloved wife the finest sepulchre ever as a  way to perpetuate her memory.

Those who had the greatest abilities were <a href='#' data-toggle='tooltip' class='translation' data-placement='top' title='contratados'>hired</a>. In 1632, over 20,000  men began the construction. When it was finished, more than twenty years later, everyone agreed that it was the most  beautiful mausoleum in the world. The emperor was so pleased with the work of art that he decided to build a matching  one across the river. However, he died before this could be done.</p><p>Most people are not <a href='#' data-toggle='tooltip' class='translation' data-placement='top' title='cientes'>aware</a> that the Taj Mahal is not an isolated building, but is part of a vast complex  comprised of a main gateway, an elaborated garden, a <a href='#' data-toggle='tooltip' class='translation' data-placement='top' title='mesquita'>mosque</a> and a <a href='#' data-toggle='tooltip' class='translation' data-placement='top' trans='ora&ccedil;&atilde;o'>prayer</a> house, outer enclosures and  enclosing walls.

If only that were true, say a  growing number of Americans. Over the past year the campaign to legalise euthanasia in the US has  suddenly gained <a href='#' data-toggle='tooltip' class='translation' data-placement='top' title='impulso'>momentum</a>. A controversial case history detailing how a doctor helped a patient commit &ldquo;suicide&rdquo; appeared in the New England Journal of Medicine in March 1991; and the following November the  State of Washington held a <a href='#' data-toggle='tooltip' class='translation' data-placement='top' title='plebiscito'>referendum</a> on a bill to legalise physician-assisted suicide. The <a href='#' data-toggle='tooltip' class='translation' data-placement='top' trans='pol&#234;mica'>issue</a> has also  taken on some bizarre twists: the introduction of a controversial &ldquo;suicide machine&rdquo; by a retired pathologist in  Michigan, and the publication of what is surely the strangest self-help book of recent years&#8212;Derek  Humphrey&#8242;s &ldquo;Final Exit&rdquo;, best seller on how to commit suicide.</p><p>The way in which euthanasia divides medical ethicists is revealing. Medical ethicists come from a  diversity of backgrounds &#8212; law, theology, history and literature, as well as from philosophy and medicine.  But it is from the latter two fields that the most vocal participants in the debate over active euthanasia have  come: philosophers in favour; and physicians opposed.</p><p>These <a href='#' data-toggle='tooltip' class='translation' data-placement='top' title='desdobramentos'>developments</a> reflect a growing distrust of the American health care system, with its  reputation for using formidable technology to prolong the lives of dying patients, often against the wishes of  relatives. <a href='#' data-toggle='tooltip' class='translation' data-placement='top' title='na verdade'>Indeed</a>, it is partly because of this distrust that the termination of life-sustaining treatment &#8212; so-  called &ldquo;passive euthanasia&rdquo; &#8212; has become morally acceptable.</p><p>Medical ethicists and the public alike accept that a mentally competent adult who is terminally ill or in  intractable pain has the right to choose to be removed from a ventilator or to refuse tube feedings and  hydration &#8212; a view which American courts have so far <a href='#' data-toggle='tooltip' class='translation' data-placement='top' title='apoiado'>upheld</a>.</p><p>By contrast, medical ethicists remain divided about active euthanasia, in which a physician ends a  patient&#8242;s life intentionally and directly: for example, by means of a lethal injection.

5;1;"Viola Caipira: the disappearance of the traditional violeiros";"<p>In traditional Brazilian culture, violeiros were considered distinguished persons and held distinguished  positions in their communities. Viola music was greatly appreciated. Thus, the knowledge of the viola was  considered an important cultural heritage. Fathers would pass their knowledge on to their sons and to others  who were highly motivated to learn the secrets and <a href='#' data-toggle='tooltip' class='translation' data-placement='top' title='sutilezas'>subtleties</a> of the instrument. </p><p>          In recent years, however, the value placed on the viola and its music has declined as <a href='#' data-toggle='tooltip' class='translation' data-placement='top' title='um todo'>a whole</a>. This  change in attitude can be traced to the process of industrialization and urbanization in Brazil. As people  migrated to the cities from the countryside, they came to look down upon the culture of the rural areas. Viola  vocal music, with its themes of life in the country, was strongly associated with rural culture and therefore  relegated to a position of inferiority. The rapid development of the communication network throughout the country also brought urban forms of music over the television and radio to all parts of Brazil, accelerating the  decline of interest in rural music forms, such as viola music.     </p><p>      Thus, violeiros today have difficulty finding an audience that appreciates their music and the  traditional rural lifestyle described in their songs. It is common to find people who use the terms &ldquo;caipira&rdquo; and  &ldquo;violeiro&rdquo; as terms with a belittling, or even pejorative, connotation. In an <a href='#' data-toggle='tooltip' class='translation' data-placement='top' title='tentativa'>attempt</a> to appeal to a <a href='#' data-toggle='tooltip' class='translation' data-placement='top' title='mais amplo'>broader</a> audience these days, some violeiros have come to play fewer toques, the traditional rhythmic-melodic  patterns, which they now call toques antigos (old toques), concentrating instead on contemporary <a href='#' data-toggle='tooltip' class='translation' data-placement='top' trans='pe&ccedil;as'>pieces</a>. In  fact, they think that today&#8242;s music is more pleasing to their audience than the mazurkas, the marchinhas  (little marches), the rural sambas, the xotes, the rancheirinhas, the catira, the folias - all <a href='#' data-toggle='tooltip' class='translation' data-placement='top' trans='g&#234;neros'>genres</a> of the  repertoire they traditionally interpreted.   </p><p>        But now some audiences are discovering (or rediscovering) the viola, one of the most representative  of the Brazilian folk instruments.       Musically, it has tremendous potential. Its timbral richness is highly impressive and its variety of <a href='#' data-toggle='tooltip' class='translation' data-placement='top' trans='afina&ccedil;&otilde;es'>tunings</a> allows for the creation of extremely harmonic fields. Some viola-players  with training in classical music are attempting to promote the instrument and its repertoire, as well as  knowledge concerning the viola, so that it can find a larger and better informed audience.    </p><p>      According to Correa, ideally, the repertoire performed on the viola should be specific to the instrument &#8212; not, for example, simply transcriptions of guitar music. Moreover, it should be linked both to  traditional music, in terms of tuning and playing techniques, as well as to the performer&#8242;s individual creativity. </p>";;;55
5;2;"Overpopulation, consumerism and environment";"<p>The world population is today over five billion and is growing fast. Even though the rate of <a href='#' data-toggle='tooltip' class='translation' data-placement='top' title='crescimento'>growth</a> has begun to decline, most demographers believe population size will still pass eight billion during the next 50  years.     </p><p>      In a sense, today&#8242;s five billion people represent a triumph of our species. Indeed, we have become the dominant animal on the planet. Through a series of technological innovations such as farming, sanitation,  and the control of many epidemic diseases, we have, as a result, found ways to reduce the rate at which we  die, creating a population explosion. In fact, biologically this is the very definition of success.     </p><p>      But there is a dark side to our triumph. We live on a finite planet, and yet we act as if its resources  were infinite. Because of overpopulation and overconsumption, humanity is incapable of supporting itself on  its &ldquo;<a href='#' data-toggle='tooltip' class='translation' data-placement='top' title='renda'>income</a>&rdquo;, that is, the energy arriving continuously from the sun. Instead, Homo  Sapiens is consuming its &ldquo;capital&rdquo;, a onetime <a href='#' data-toggle='tooltip' class='translation' data-placement='top' title='fonte de riqueza'>bonanza</a> of nonrenewable fossil fuels as well as other mineral  resources that formed over eons and are now being destroyed and dispersed in decades. Moreover, we are  doing the same with vital resources not usually thought of as being nonrenewable like deep fertile agricultural  soils, groundwater, and biodiversity.      </p><p>     The mechanisms that supply us with income are ecosystems, that is, plants, animals, and  microorganisms interacting with each other and their physical <a href='#' data-toggle='tooltip' class='translation' data-placement='top' title='meio ambiente'>environments</a>. The vast <a href='#' data-toggle='tooltip' class='translation' data-placement='top' title='variedade'>array</a> of organisms  that ecosystems support can be though of as a giant genetic library. Although humanity has already taken  from that library the very basis of its civilization in the form of <a href='#' data-toggle='tooltip' class='translation' data-placement='top' trans='planta&ccedil;&otilde;es'>crops</a>, domestic animals, industrial materials,  and medicines, its potential is still almost intact.      </p><p>     Understanding ecosystems and how civilization is living on capital provides the appropriate context  for analysing the population problem. Numbers per se are not the measure of overpopulation; instead, it is  the impact of people on ecosystems and nonrenewable resources. While developing countries severely <a href='#' data-toggle='tooltip' class='translation' data-placement='top' title='sobrecarregar'>tax</a>  their environments, the populations of rich countries leave a vastly disproportionate mark on the planet.    </p><p>       For instance, the birth of a baby in the United States imposes more than a hundred times the stress  on the world&#8242;s resources and environment as a birth in, say, Bangladesh. Babies from Bangladesh do not  grow up to own automobiles and air conditioners. Their life-styles do not require <a href='#' data-toggle='tooltip' class='translation' data-placement='top' title='enormes'>huge</a> quantities of minerals  and energy, therefore their activities do not seriously undermine the life-support capability of the entire  planet. In fact, the average US family affects the environment 40 times more than a family of the same size  in India or 100 times more than one in Kenya.</p><p>       For example, tropical forests are known to be the major reservoir of biodiversity of species that can  supply humanity with many direct benefits. Although it is often unsuccessful, the <a href='#' data-toggle='tooltip' class='translation' data-placement='top' title='desmatamento'>clearing</a> of tropical forests is  usually an attempt to provide farms for rapidly growing populations of poor people. But it also results from the  <a href='#' data-toggle='tooltip' class='translation' data-placement='top' trans='abund&acirc;ncia'>affluence</a> of people in rich countries. Central American forests are sometimes destroyed for <a href='#' data-toggle='tooltip' class='translation' data-placement='top' title='terras de pastagens'>pastureland</a> to  make pet food and convenience food in The United States slightly <a href='#' data-toggle='tooltip' class='translation' data-placement='top' title='mais barato'>cheaper</a>. Likewise, in Papua New Guinea  forests are destroyed to supply <a href='#' data-toggle='tooltip' class='translation' data-placement='top' trans='papel&atilde;o'>cardboard</a> packaging for Japanese electronic products. Thus, a rich person  thousands of miles away may cause more tropical forest destruction than a poor person living within the  forest itself. </p><p>      In short, while rapid population growth in poor countries may impede the escape from poverty and  lead to local environmental deterioration, overpopulation and resource consumption in rich nations <a href='#' data-toggle='tooltip' class='translation' data-placement='top' trans='amea&ccedil;a'>threatens</a>  earth&#8242;s capacity to sustain us all.</p>.";;;92
5;3;"Marshmallows and emotional inteligence";"<p>The phrase &ldquo;emotional intelligence&rdquo; was <a href='#' data-toggle='tooltip' class='translation' data-placement='top' title='concebida'>coined</a> by Yale psychologist Peter Salovey and the University of  New Hampshire&#8242;s John Myer some years ago to describe qualities like understanding one&#8242;s own <a href='#' data-toggle='tooltip' class='translation' data-placement='top' title='sentimentos'>feelings</a>,  empathy for the feelings of others and &ldquo;the regulation of emotion in order to live a better life&rdquo;. Scientists are  finding that emotion is absolutely necessary to intelligent life. For example, <a href='#' data-toggle='tooltip' class='translation' data-placement='top' title='ansiedade'>anxiety</a> is in fact a <a href='#' data-toggle='tooltip' class='translation' data-placement='top' title='alerta'>rehearsal</a> for  danger. Although too much anxiety can paralyse the mind, a little anxiety <a href='#' data-toggle='tooltip' class='translation' data-placement='top' title='na verdade'>actually</a> helps focus it. In other  words, what one needs is the right dose of emotion at the right time.     </p><p>       In one experiment used to investigate the relationship between emotion and intelligence, the researcher invites a group of four-year-old children, one by one, into a simple room and begins the gentle torment: &ldquo;You can have this marshmallow right now&rdquo;, he says &ldquo;but if you wait while I go out for a minute, you can have two marshmallows when I get back&rdquo;. Some children <a href='#' data-toggle='tooltip' class='translation' data-placement='top' title='agarrar'>grab</a> for the marshmallow as soon as he  leaves. Others, although they are determined to wait, resist but a few minutes. Others wait. While some children cover their eyes, others put their heads down so that they can resist the temptation. While some try  to play games, others sing to themselves. Some even <a href='#' data-toggle='tooltip' class='translation' data-placement='top' title='adormecem'>fall asleep</a>. The children who wait are eventually given  the <a href='#' title='hard-earned' title='duramente conquistado'>hard-earned</a> marshmallows. And then science waits for them to grow up.     </p><p>       As a result of this experiment, researchers have discovered that those who as four-year-old kids had  the <a href='#' data-toggle='tooltip' class='translation' data-placement='top' trans='for&ccedil;a, coragem'>fortitude</a> to wait for the second marshmallows generally grow up to be better adjusted, more popular, adventurous, confident and dependable teenagers. <a href='#' data-toggle='tooltip' class='translation' data-placement='top' title='por outro lado'>On the other hand</a>, the children who gave in to  temptation early on are more <a href='#' data-toggle='tooltip' class='translation' data-placement='top' title='tendem'>likely</a> to be <a href='#' data-toggle='tooltip' class='translation' data-placement='top' trans='solit&aacute;rio'>lonely</a>, <a href='#' data-toggle='tooltip' class='translation' data-placement='top' title='teimosos'>stubborn</a>, as well as easily frustrated. They don&#8242;t do well  under stress, <a href='#' data-toggle='tooltip' class='translation' data-placement='top' title='evitam desafios'>avoid challenges</a> and do poorly on <a href='#' data-toggle='tooltip' class='translation' data-placement='top' title='teste do tipo vestibular'>scholastic aptitude tests</a>.      </p><p>      The marshmallow experiment was an important step in the development of a theory of emotional  intelligence for it indicated that the ability to <a href='#' data-toggle='tooltip' class='translation' data-placement='top' title='retardar'>delay</a> gratification is a master <a href='#' data-toggle='tooltip' class='translation' data-placement='top' title='habilidade'>skill</a>. It is actually a triumph of the reasoning brain over the impulsive one. Moreover, it illustrates the belief of those researchers that regulation  of emotion in a <a href='#' title='life-enhancing' title='que beneficia a vida'>life-enhancing</a> way is an important sign of emotional intelligence.</p>";;;58
5;4;"Is race a criterion to judge people's value?";"<p>Why do readers continue to get <a href='#' data-toggle='tooltip' class='translation' data-placement='top' trans='agitados, bravos'>steamed up</a> about race? <a href='#' data-toggle='tooltip' class='translation' data-placement='top' title='entretanto'>Although</a> it may be an innocuous concept in  anthropology, discussions about race normally <a href='#' data-toggle='tooltip' class='translation' data-placement='top' trans='reduzem-se a, resumem-se a'>boil down</a> to racism and <a href='#' data-toggle='tooltip' class='translation' data-placement='top' title='humores'>tempers</a> begin <a href='#' data-toggle='tooltip' class='translation' data-placement='top' trans='alterar-se'>to fray</a>. But it has not  always been that way. When we look back on History, evidence <a href='#' data-toggle='tooltip' class='translation' data-placement='top' title='permite'>allows</a> us to say that this term was once  used to describe common cultural origins. So when did this concept take on new <a href='#' data-toggle='tooltip' class='translation' data-placement='top' title='significados'>meanings</a>? Colonization  seems to be the one event that <a href='#' data-toggle='tooltip' class='translation' data-placement='top' title='produzir'>brought forth</a> changes in the word so as to show the colonizers as superior.    </p><p>       In their <a href='#' data-toggle='tooltip' class='translation' data-placement='top' trans='esfor&ccedil;o'>endeavour</a> to classify races, most famous scientists from the 18th and 19th centuries revealed marked differences except for one: they all put Caucasians at the top, in a hierarchical way. Only  after the Darwinian revolution was it possible to have a clearer picture that led UNESCO to emphatically  condemn racism in the 1940s.      </p><p>     That classifications cannot be hierarchical does not mean, <a href='#' data-toggle='tooltip' class='translation' data-placement='top' title='no entanto'>though</a>, that they are useless or that  anthropologists cannot gather people into different groups. Classifications can constitute vital <a href='#' data-toggle='tooltip' class='translation' data-placement='top' title='ferramentas'>tools</a> in certain  cases, such as in the use of physical differences to identify the geographical origins of ethnic groups in descriptive anthropology. <a href='#' data-toggle='tooltip' class='translation' data-placement='top' title='Entretanto'>However</a>, physical differences are usually the result of superficial adaptation to  different climates and are simply useful indicators of group origins; nothing else can be inferred from them.      </p><p>     Anyone <a href='#' data-toggle='tooltip' class='translation' data-placement='top' title='tentando'>attempting</a> to <a href='#' data-toggle='tooltip' class='translation' data-placement='top' title='avaliar'>assess</a> more important differences, such as cognitive abilities, will be <a href='#' data-toggle='tooltip' class='translation' data-placement='top' title='levado'>led</a> to the  well-known conclusion that there are more differences within a single group than between the average  members of any two groups. This implies that nothing really important can be said about any individual on  the basis of his race (however defined). To use race as a criterion for judging the value of a specific group is  a dangerous proposition, since it is based on ideological interests and not on scientific observation.    </p><p>      It is also interesting to point out that <a href='#' data-toggle='tooltip' class='translation' data-placement='top' title='muito embora'>even though</a> race is used as a classification tool, the  identification of origins is not as simple as most people tend to think. <a href='#' data-toggle='tooltip' class='translation' data-placement='top' title='Leigos'>Lay</a> men usually believe they can  easily identify a person&#8242;s race or nationality. Tests prove how wrong this <a href='#' data-toggle='tooltip' class='translation' data-placement='top' title='premissa'>assumption</a> may be. As an example,  a New Scientist correspondent once positively identified as Australian, Sicilian, Sumatran and Brazilian  four people who actually were from Sweden, Greece, the central African Republic and Russia, respectively.  This experiment suggests that classification according to physical characteristics may be extremely <a href='#' data-toggle='tooltip' class='translation' data-placement='top' title='tendenciosa'>biased</a>,  guided by stereotypical <a href='#' data-toggle='tooltip' class='translation' data-placement='top' trans='id&eacute;ias pr&eacute;-concebidas'>preconceptions</a> and not by disinterested norms of scientific observation. </p>";;;72
6;1;"Why coffee addicts need their fix";"<p>People who can't get going until after that first cup of coffee in the morning may be suffering from caffeine <a href='#' data-toggle='tooltip' class='translation' data-placement='top' trans='s&#237;ndrome de abstin&#234;ncia'>&#168;cold turkey&#168;</a>. Peter Rogers, head of psychobiology at the Institute of Food Research in Reading, suggests that rather than improving concentration, the early morning <a href='#' data-toggle='tooltip' class='translation' data-placement='top' trans='dose de droga da qual se &#233; dependente'>&#168;fix&#168;</a> simply protects against the <a href='#' data-toggle='tooltip' class='translation' data-placement='top' trans='abstin&#234;ncia'>withdrawal</a> symptoms that are frequent after a night witout caffeine. Symptons include headaches, lethargy, <a href='#' data-toggle='tooltip' class='translation' data-placement='top' trans='sonol&#234;ncia'>drowsiness</a> and poor concentration.</p><p>&#168;We feel more alert after our first cup of tea or coffee because it is reversing the withdrawal symptons that we are beginning to experience&#168;, says Rogers. He says that although many people drink coffee to <a href='#' data-toggle='tooltip' class='translation' data-placement='top' title='estimular'>sharpen</a> their minds, they are only bringing their performance back to normal.</p><p>Rogers gave volunteers two or more cups of coffee or tea each day, but instructed them to abstain from the evening <a href='#' data-toggle='tooltip' class='translation' data-placement='top' title='em diante'>onwards</a>. In the morning, half the volunteers were given drinks containing caffeine and half decaffeinated drinks. When asked to <a href='#' data-toggle='tooltip' class='translation' data-placement='top' title='avaliar'>rate</a> their feelings of energy and <a href='#' title='clear-headedness' title='acuidade mental'>clear-headedness</a>, those drinking coffee were the most alert. People disliked their decaffeinated drinks because they did nothing to alleviate the symptoms of withdrawal.</p><p>Rogers thinks this may help to explain why people need their morning &#168;fix&#168;, but it throws no light on how ow why people acquire a liking for such <a href='#' data-toggle='tooltip' class='translation' data-placement='top' title='amargo'>bitter</a>-tasting drinks. Previous studies have suggested that <a href='#' data-toggle='tooltip' class='translation' data-placement='top' trans='press&#227;o do grupo social'>peer pressure</a> and the example set by parents may encourage people to start drinking coffee.</p><p>Roland Griffiths of Johns Hopkins University in Maryland says: &#168;It is very clear that caffeine does produce dependency in chronic use.&#168;</p>";;;31
6;2;"Garlic fights off undead bacteria";"<p>Legend has it that garlic will repel <a href='#' data-toggle='tooltip' class='translation' data-placement='top' title='sedento por sangue'>bloodthirsty</a> vampires. Now doctors in the US have found that it may fight off the more pressing <a href='#' data-toggle='tooltip' class='translation' data-placement='top' trans='amea&#231;a'>menace</a> of antibiotic-resistant bacteria.</p><p>Jerome Klein of Boston University Medical Center and Karen Farbman, now at the Rhode Island Hospital, tested the plant against a variety of infectious microorganisms. They found that freshly pressed garlic extract, even diluted to one part in 250 proved effective against all the organisms in the laboratory study, including drug-resistant <a href='#' data-toggle='tooltip' class='translation' data-placement='top' title='variedades'>strains</a> of bacteria.</p><p>&#168;The garlic extract definitely inhibited and killed the bacteria&#168;, affirms Klein. The team's findings were published in the <i>Pediatric Infectious Disease Journal</i> (Vol. 12, p613).</p><p>Klein believes that the plant's effectiveness is probably <a href='#' data-toggle='tooltip' class='translation' data-placement='top' trans='devido &#224;'>due to</a> allicin, a simple organic disulphide that is known to be an antibacterial agent. Allicin is also responsible for garlic's pungent odor. Klein cautions that while the laboratory <a href='#' data-toggle='tooltip' class='translation' data-placement='top' title='testes'>trials</a> give reason for optimism, it is not yet clear how much allicin reaches sites of infection when we eat garlic, or even <a href='#' data-toggle='tooltip' class='translation' data-placement='top' title='se'>whether</a> it acts as an antibiotic if it does get there. But with resistance to commercial antibiotics becoming an increasing problem, he predicts the time has come for this <a href='#' data-toggle='tooltip' class='translation' data-placement='top' title='antigo'>ancient</a> remedy to step out of the annals of folk medicine.</p>";;;35
6;3;"Canadian Parents Desire More Sons";"<p>A common belief is that parents in rural communities of less developed countries prefer to have sons <a href='#' data-toggle='tooltip' class='translation' data-placement='top' title='enquanto que'>whereas</a> those in developed countries desire <a href='#' data-toggle='tooltip' class='translation' data-placement='top' title='aproximadamente'>roughly</a> equal number of sons and daughters. This belief has been shown to be wrong in at least one developed country. In Canada, there is a definite, if less strong, preference for sons (Journal of Biosocial Science, vol. 25, p.212). </p> <p>Vijaya Drishnan of th University of Alberta came to this conclusion after studying the <a href='#' data-toggle='tooltip' class='translation' data-placement='top' title='de controle de natalidade'>contraceptive</a> practices of Canadian women. He used data from the Canadian Fertility Survey, a study of 5315 married or co-habiting women between 18 and 49. Krishnan found that women who already have two sons are significantly more <a href='#' data-toggle='tooltip' class='translation' data-placement='top' trans='prov&#225;vel'>likely</a> to be using contraception than those with two daughters and no sons.</p> <p> More than half of the women using contraception in Canada choose to be sterilized. This suggests that these women have made a definite decision not to have any more children. Because it is well known that couples <a href='#' data-toggle='tooltip' class='translation' data-placement='top' title='adiam'>postpone</a> the use of effective contraception until their family is the size and composition they desire, it seems there is still a distinct preference for sons in Canada.</p> <p>If, as Krishnan believes, this preference for sons has survived even in a highly developed country such as Canada, then it would appear to be not just a consequence of the stage of development of a society but an <a href='#' data-toggle='tooltip' class='translation' data-placement='top' title='inerente'>inherent</a> preference. He <a href='#' data-toggle='tooltip' class='translation' data-placement='top' trans='supor, suspeitar'>surmises</a> that if techniques for determining a fetu's sex become widely available and more efficient, then this preference for sons could <a href='#' data-toggle='tooltip' class='translation' data-placement='top' title='finalmente'>eventually</a> <a href='#' data-toggle='tooltip' class='translation' data-placement='top' title='levar a'>lead</a> to an <a href='#' data-toggle='tooltip' class='translation' data-placement='top' trans='desequil&#237;brio'>imbalance</a> between the sexes, which would almost certainly have considerable social consequences.</p><p><a href=http://www.newscientist.com/"">New Scientist</a>, 24 April 1993</p>""";;;32
